- insights into trade offs of fitness vs computational trade off
- test with seeding oscillators
- ROI on computational investment
- run for 1000 trials x 2
- More generations?
-- THings might not be evenly separated.
- seed with oscillator that is broken, do you recover the same one or get different ones
- profile to see what the integrator is taking up
- Explore DoE
-- add tournament selecton option, look at time and yield, also try roulette, for tournament allow to pick from total population or just the bottom guy. 
-- 15% yield
- preload something that is almost an oscillator and then see how fast you recover it to do for design of experiments. Speeds up and allows faster evaluation of features
