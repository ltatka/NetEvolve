# NetEvolve
## Purpose
This module allows the user to easily run an evolutionary algorithm to create mass-action chemical reaction networks with oscillatory behavior.

## How to use
### Installing Julia
This module uses the julia programming language. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

### Quick Start
1. Either fork or clone this module. Clone via the command ```git clone https://github.com/ltatka/NetEvolve```
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the NetEvolve repo: ```cd NetEvolve```

#### Command Line
1. To install the NetEvolve module and all dependencies: ```julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'```
2. To run evolution with default settings: ```julia --project=. run_evolution.jl``` <br>
This command also takes optional command line arguments: <br>
* ```--nbatches```: the number of batches to run (100 by default)
* ```--ngenerations```: the number of generations per batch (800 by default)
* ```--populationsize```: the number of networks in a population
* ```--pathtosettings```: path to a json file storing additional custom settings
* ```--outputpath```: path to a directory where evolution output will be written
* ```--seed```: specify a seed for the random number generator
For example, to change the populationsize to 200 via the command line: <br>
```julia --project=. run_evolution.jl --populationsize=200```

#### Bash Script
```./quickstart.sh``` to run evolution with default settings. This script can also be edited to include the command line arguements in the previous section.

#### Write your own scripts
1. Use the run_evolution in a .jl file as follows <br>
```
using NetEvolve
NetEvolve.run_evolution()
```

2. Command line arguments can be specified as keyword arguments in the ```run_evolution``` function.
For example ```NetEvolve.run_evolution(ngenerations=500)```


## Additional Custom Settings
#### Specify Additional Settings in a JSON File
Additional settings can be specified in a JSON file. <br>
When using the command line or bash script, the path can be supplied as a flag argument:
```julia --project=. evscript.jl --pathtosettings="/home/name/path/to/your/settings.json"```

When using the NetEvolve module in a .jl script:
```run_evolution(pathtosettings="/home/name/path/to/your/settings.json")```

An example of a JSON file specifying custom settings: <br>
```
{"specieslist": ["A", "B", "C"],
"initialconditions": [5.0, 3.0, 6.0],
"reactionprobabilities": [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2],
"ngenerations": 500,
"populationsize": 200,
}
```
Any settings that are not specified in the JSON file will be set to the default value.
